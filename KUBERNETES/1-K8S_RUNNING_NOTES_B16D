1. What Docker & Docker Compose Do Well ???

Docker helps you:

      Package your app and dependencies into portable containers.      
      Run the same container anywhere (dev, test, prod).      
      Isolate processes and environments.
      
Docker Compose adds:

    Multi-container setup — e.g., running a web app + DB + Redis + xyz ..etc  together.    
    Simple configuration — define everything in docker-compose.yml.    
    Great for local development and small deployments.
    
So far, so good , we can 

    Package apps consistently (Dockerfile) 
    Define multiple containers easily (docker-compose.yml)
    Run them locally with one command
    Even auto-restart containers with restart: always



CHALLENGES WITH DOCKER &  DOCKER COMPOSE 
========================

1 Scaling and High Availability

     Docker Compose doesn’t automatically scale containers across multiple machines.     
     If one container/node fails, you need to manually restart or handle failover.     
     No built-in load balancing or auto-recovery.

2 Multi-host / Cluster Management
      Docker Compose works mostly on a single host (machine)
      Real production systems need to run across multiple servers or clouds — Compose doesn’t handle that.

3. Self-healing & Monitoring
      If a container crashes, Compose won’t automatically reschedule or replace it.   
      You need to handle health checks and restarts manually.

4. Rolling Updates / Zero-downtime Deployments

      Docker Compose lacks advanced deployment strategies (rolling updates, blue-green, canary, etc.).

5. Networking & Service Discovery

      Compose’s network works fine locally, but in a distributed environment you need dynamic service discovery, DNS, and load balancing — which Compose doesn’t provide natively.
	  
6. Resource Management

     You can set limits, but no cluster-level scheduling based on CPU/RAM usage	 
	 
7.  Monitoring and logging need extra tools	 
	 


- DOCKER CAN NOT ORCHESTRATE

==============================================
DOCKER 

CONT.ORC CONCEPTS ---> DOCKER SWARM / K8S 


-------------------------------------------------------
WHY KUBERNETES (K8S):
=========================
- Production-grade scaling
- High Availability 
- Self-healing: 
- Automated rollouts , rollback & zero downtime
- Automates container orchestration & Automated Scheduling (hpa) 
- Scales containers up or down easily
- Handles networking across clusters
- Built-in load balancing
- Simplifies deployment and updates



========================================================================
What is Kubernetes?
•	Kubernetes is an orchestration engine and open-source platform for managing containerized applications.
•	Born in Google ,written in Go/Golang. Donated to CNCF(Cloud native computing foundation) in 2014.
•	Kubernetes v1.0 was released on July 21, 2015.


FEATURES:

•	Automated Scheduling: 
Kubernetes provides advanced scheduler to launch container on cluster nodes based on their resource
requirements and other constraints, while not sacrificing availability.

•	Self Healing Capabilities:
 Kubernetes allows to replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die. It also kills containers that don’t
respond to user-defined health check and doesn’t advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.

•	Automated rollouts & rollback: 
Kubernetes rolls out changes to the application or its configuration while monitoring application health
to ensure it doesn’t kill all your instances at the same time. If something goes wrong, with Kubernetes you can rollback the change.

•	Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing:
 Kubernetes can scale up and scale down the application as per the requirements with a simple
command, using a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.

WHY K8S 

High availability , Zero downtime , 

K8S ARCHITECTURE:
================

Kubernetes Architecture is based on a master-worker model, where the Master manages and controls the cluster, and the Workers run the containerized applications. Let's break down the architecture and its core components.

KUBERNETES ARCHITECTURE :

Master Node:    The control plane responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster.
Worker Nodes:   The nodes that run the containerized applications (pods).
Cluster:        A set of worker nodes managed by the master node.


---------------------------------------

1. MASTER NODE (CONTROL PLANE): 
============================
The Master Node is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster. 
It manages the cluster, maintains the desired state, schedules workloads, and monitors the overall health of the cluster.
It consists of several critical components:

     KUBE-APISERVER:     
     The API server is the central point of contact for all Kubernetes components. It handles requests from clients, whether that’s the kubectl CLI, the Kubernetes UI, or other components in the system.     
     The API server exposes the REST API, which is used by external clients to interact with Kubernetes. It ensures the system’s state is updated.
	 
    -  The entry point /Gateway to the Kubernetes cluster.
    -  All commands (like kubectl) talk to the API server.
    -  Think of it as the front desk of K8s.
	   
	 
	 
     ETCD:     
 
	- A key-value database that stores all cluster data — pods, deployments, secrets, etc.
	- It is highly available and persistent - Kubernetes can recover the cluster's state even after a failure.
	- etcd ensures consistency across the entire cluster.
    - It’s like Kubernetes’ memory.
     
	 
     KUBE-SCHEDULER:     
     
	- Watches for new pods that need to be scheduled.
    - Decides which node a pod should run on (based on resources, affinity rules, etc)  
    - ensures that workloads are distributed across nodes in an efficient and optimal manner.
     
     
	 KUBE-CONTROLLER-MANAGER:     
	 
	- Runs various controllers (like replica controller, node controller, etc.) 
    - Ensure that the cluster's desired state is maintained. (desired state = actual state) 
    - Ex: if you said you want 3 replicas but only 2 are running, it creates 1 more. 

     
     CLOUD-CONTROLLER-MANAGER (OPTIONAL):     
	 
    - This component is used when running Kubernetes in a cloud environment. 
	- Interacts with the underlying cloud provider (e.g., AWS, AZURE , Google Cloud) to manage resources like    load balancers, volumes, and instances.
	- It helps in maintaining cloud-specific services in coordination with Kubernetes.
     
	 
2. WORKER NODE COMPONENTS:
===========================

     A Worker Node (also called a Minion) runs the applications and workloads in the form of Pods. Each worker node contains the following components:
     
     KUBELET:     
	 
	- The agent on each worker node that talks to the API Server.
	-  Makes sure containers are running as instructed.
	- takes action to rectify any issues (e.g., restarting a failed container).
	
     
	 
     KUBE-PROXY:     
	 
	- Handles networking — ensures pods can talk to each other and the internet.
	- Manages load balancing and routing traffic to the right pod.     
	
     
     CONTAINER RUNTIME (DOCKER/ cri-o / containerd)  

    - Runs the containers inside a pod (Docker, containerd, CRI-O, etc).
    - It pulls container images, starts containers, and manages the lifecycle of containers within the pods.
	 
======================================     
     PODS:     
	 
	- Pod : The Smallest Deployable Unit in K8S
    - Pod is the basic building block in Kubernetes.
	- It wraps one or more containers that share the same network and storage.
	- Usually, one container per pod (but sometimes more if they’re tightly coupled).
	 

So who actually makes the pod run ? 
   
   
   API Server - Accepts pod creation requests, validates and stores them in etcd 
   Scheduler - Watches for unscheduled pods, selects a node - Decides which node should host the pod
   API Server - Updates Pod with node assignment     
   Kubelet	-  on the chosen node , talks to Container Runtime to  create containers, 
   
   
 So kubelet Actually runs and monitors the pod on its node, kubelet reports status back to API SERVER 

=============================================================================================


Where can you set up a Kubernetes cluster?

1. Self-managed cluster - You install and manage everything yourself.
    Treditional approach - Self managed , barematel , customer managed k8s cluster 
    Kubeadm → install K8s manually on servers (on-prem or in the cloud).
	
	
  Kubernetes Control Plane - Self Managed  
        Need to make Control Plane Highly Available
        Maintain multiple EC2 in multiple AZ
        Scale Control Plane if needed
        Keep etcd up and running
        Overhead of managing EC2s
        Security Patching
        Replace failed EC2s/vms/physical servers
        Orchestration for Kubernetes Version Upgrade

2. Managed Kubernetes services (cloud)
    
	 k8s cluster as a service , Cloud providers give you a ready-to-use Kubernetes control plane.
     You just focus on your apps, not managing Kubernetes itself.

         AWS	   EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
         GCP      GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
         Azure	   AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)



   
   CLOUD MANAGED KUBERNETES ( EKS / AKS / GKE ) 

       Kubernetes Control Plane - AWS Managed - eks
       
       ● AWS Manages Kubernetes Control Plane 
       ● Creates and manages the Control Plane for you (API server, etcd, scheduler, etc.)
       ● Handles upgrades, scaling, and security patches automatically.
       ● AWS maintains High Availability - Multiple EC2s in Multiple AZs
       ● AWS Detects and Replaces Unhealthy Control Plane Instances
       ● AWS Scales Control Plane
       ● Provides Automated Version Upgrade and Patching


   in EKS you only need to manage Data Plane 

   ● Create Worker Nodes (EC2 instances or Fargate tasks)   - we will use managed node groups 
   ● Deploy our  Pods and apps.
   ● Cluster configuration
   ● Security policies
   ● Monitoring/logging
   
   
   

EKS K8S CLUSTER SETUP 


====================================================

Ways To Spin Up EKS Cluster:

           
           eksctl CLI
		   
		   
          
What is eksctl - CloudFormation stack
  

     ● CLI tool for creating clusters on EKS
     ● Easier than console
     ● Abstracts lots of stuff - VPC, Subnet, Sec. Group , nodes , docker etc.
     using CloudFormation stack 

=======================	   
aws configure

aws sts get-caller-identity

once configure is done , our terminal will have admin accss to our aws account 


=======================================================
eksctl create cluster  

--> it creates  two m5.large large nodes by default for data plane . Insted go for t3.micro

  
     Control Plane - AWS WILL TAKE CARE !   
     Data Plane  - 2 m5.large worker nodes 


eksctl create cluster --name <name> --version <> --nodegroup-name <> --node-type t3.micro --nodes 4 --managed 



eksctl create cluster --name b16dcluster  --nodegroup-name b16ng --node-type t3.micro --nodes 4 --managed

-------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROL PLANE (MASTER NODES) :

Kubernetes master nodes are distributed across several AWS availability zones (AZ), and traffic is managed by Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

EKS is a managed service, so you have no direct access to the master nodes. And you don't need the access.
==================================

pod - Containers are encapsulated into a k8s object called pod ,in simple words pod is a abstraction on containers 

Pod can have multiple continers but in general not of same container type (mostly helper container) 	

--------------------------------------------
Creating a POD from Commandline : 


docker run --name cot1 image
kubectl run testpod --image=tomcat 


history:

 eksctl create cluster --name testcluster  --nodegroup-name testng --node-type t3.micro --nodes 5 --managed

status = active 
owner = Madhu

name = whatsapp
owner = kiran
created = 13-10-2025

REPLICA SET: 




spec : we will create a template section under spec to provide a pod template to be used by Replication contoller/ Relica set to create replicas 


Replication Controller vs Replica set :

   Replica set requires a selector defination 
   i,e 
   seletor is not mandate for RC ,
   but for Replica set it is mandate , a user input is required for this property like match labels 


FOR REEPLICA SET manifest files ---> -
check for  manifest files in zip folder

kubectl api-resources --->resorces we can create like podscontainers,deployments...etc

kubectl api-resources | grep pod 
--------
kubectl cordon instance ip ---> unschedule the nodes ,no new pod will be schedule
Marks a node as unschedulable—new pods will not be scheduled on it, but existing pods continue to run.. 
when You want to stop placing new workloads on the node but don't want to disrupt what's already running.
--------

kubectl drain ip-172-20-103-135.ec2.internal --->  evicts all pods to another node and schedule will be disable
--------
kubectl uncordon ip-172-20-38-30.ec2.internal


kubectl get all

kubectl get replicaset
NAME     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
tomcat   5         5         5       116s
-----------

So Why do we need labels and Selectoers ?

Labels can be used as filter to replica set , so replica set will monitor and ensure desired no of pods are running 

==========================================================
scale replicas and ways to scale :

1. kubectl scale replicaset insta-rs --replicas=3
1. Change manifest file -->- then kubectl apply -f insta-rs.yaml
3. kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f insta-rs.yaml
4. kubectl edit replicaset <replicasetname> --> opens a temporoay file in memory

In Kubernetes, Service types are abstractions that define how to expose Pods. The common types are:

      ClusterIP (default)
      
      NodePort
      
      LoadBalancer

-------------------------------------------

flow :

                   Client (Internet)
                      ↓
                   External Load Balancer
                      ↓
                   NodePort (on a Kubernetes Node)
                      ↓
                   ClusterIP (Kubernetes internal)
                      ↓
                   Pod (endpoint)

NameSpaces :

Namespaces are Kubernetes objects which partition a single Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters

which means that using the combination of an object name and a Namespace, each object gets an unique identity across the cluster.
------------

A namespace in Kubernetes is a way to divide your cluster into smaller, isolated spaces for better organization and management.
------------

When you have a big Kubernetes cluster that runs many applications, you don’t want everything mixed together.
So, you create namespaces to separate and organize things.

Example:

Imagine you have one big Kubernetes cluster for your company.

You can make:

     dev namespace → for developers to test things     
     staging namespace → for testing before release     
     prod namespace → for real users
     
Each namespace can have its own:

       Pods (containers)       
       Services       
       Configurations       
       Resource limits (CPU, memory, etc.)

And Kubernetes makes sure that things in one namespace don’t clash with another — for example, you can have a web service in both dev and prod, and they won’t conflict.

--------------------------------------------------------

kubectl get pod -o wide
kubectl get pod -o wide --all-namespaces

=================================

kubectl get ns

kubectl create ns kirannamespace

kubectl apply  -f pod.yaml -n kirannamespace

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

=========================================

Resource requests & limits :

Resource Requests
A request is the amount of CPU and memory that Kubernetes will allocate to a container. When you specify a request, Kubernetes ensures that your container will always have at least that much resource available when it runs

------------
LIMITS : 
The maximum amount of CPU and memory the container can use. 
If the container exceeds these, it may be throttled (CPU) or killed (Memory).

-------
     Kubernetes has no idea how much CPU/memory this needs.
     It might schedule it anywhere.     
     If the node gets busy, this pod could slow down or get evicted.     
     It can also use unlimited CPU/memory, possibly hurting other apps.	  
	  

========================================================


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-resources
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx:latest
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "200m"     # needs at least 0.2 of a CPU core
          memory: "256Mi" # needs at least 256 MB of RAM
        limits:
          cpu: "500m"     # can use up to 0.5 CPU core
          memory: "512Mi" # can use up to 512 MB of RAM
		  
		  
---------------------------------------------------		  
   Kubernetes knows this pod needs a small amount of CPU/memory to start.   
   It will schedule it on a node that has enough room.   
   If the pod tries to use more than the limit   
       CPU: it just gets throttled (slowed down).       
       Memory: it gets killed (OOMKilled) to protect the node.

ENV vs CONFIG MAP vs  SECRET 

Environment Variables (ENV):

        environment variables are key–value pairs injected into the container’s runtime environment.
        App configs like port numbers, feature flags, etc.
        Env variables are Typically non-sensitive.
        Not encrypted.
        Easily visible in kubectl describe pod.

You can define them:

       Directly in a Pod spec
       Or indirectly using a ConfigMap or Secret
=====================

ENV:

--- 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: envex-pod 

spec: 
  containers:
    - name: insta-pod-cont
      image: devopshubg333/batch16d:fb_httpd
      env:
        - name: Course
          value: AWS DevOps 

        - name: Trainer 
          value: Madhukiran Gorekar 

        - name: Institute
          value: MindCircuit 
    

=====================

ConfigMap

   ConfigMaps are Kubernetes API objects that store configuration data as key–value pairs (strings).
    They’re meant for non-sensitive settings.

Ways to use a ConfigMap:
      As environment variables
      As command-line arguments
      As files mounted into a container


configmap.yaml:


---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mc-config

data:
  Course: AWS DevOps 
  Trainer: Madhukiran Gorekar
  Institute: MindCircuit


-------------------------------------------------

--- 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-ex-pod 

spec: 
  containers:
    - name: insta-pod-cont
      image: devopshubg333/batch16d:fb_httpd

      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: mc-config

===========================================

Secret:

 Secrets are like ConfigMaps, but intended for sensitive data such as credentials or tokens.
Kubernetes stores them base64-encoded, not encrypted by default (though you can enable encryption at rest).

A Secret is used to store sensitive data, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, SSH keys, and API keys, in a way that is more secure than using a plain ConfigMap. 

Secrets are encoded (base64), which helps to obscure their content but is not a fully secure solution; they are more secure than environment variables or plain text files
